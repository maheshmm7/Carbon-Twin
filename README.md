# Carbon Twin AI™ 🌍✨

> **A Personalized Digital Twin Simulator & AI Carbon Coach**
> Built for the PromptWars Challenge 3. Combines deterministic scientific math, real-time habit simulation, and context-aware generative AI into one seamless single-scroll experience.

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Carbon Twin AI™** is a digital twin simulator that translates the abstract concept of carbon footprints into an emotional, interactive, and actionable journey. Most carbon calculators suffer from complex data entry, boring grids, and generic advice. Carbon Twin AI™ solves this by generating a personalized digital twin in under 60 seconds using only 5 key lifestyle questions, showing you how your current habits project into the future, and giving you an AI Carbon Coach to help you reform them.

### 🎯 Target Persona
* **Primary**: Young professionals, students, and remote workers looking for rapid, visual feedback.
* **Secondary**: Families and eco-conscious learners looking to simulate how domestic shifts (like electric vehicles or solar panels) impact their long-term footprint.

## 🎯 Challenge Alignment (PromptWars Challenge 3)

The project is designed to stand out in the PromptWars competition by focusing on:
1. **Low Friction**: Get an actionable footprint assessment and meet your "Carbon Twin" in under a minute.
2. **Emotional Engagement**: The **Life Replay** chapter narrative and visceral **Earth Consequences** make the numbers feel immediate and human.
3. **Interactive Simulation**: The **Habit Sandbox** allows judges and users to toggle lifestyle changes (e.g., eating plant-based, installing solar panels) and watch their twin's Aura react in real-time.
4. **Resiliency & Fallbacks**: If the Gemini API is unavailable, the application gracefully degrades to local heuristic recommendations and pre-written chapters without crashing.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Deterministic Digital Twin & Carbon Auras
Evaluates diet, transit, home energy, travel, and shopping patterns to calculate your footprint in annual CO2e tonnes. Based on scientific carbon thresholds, users are assigned a deterministic **Carbon Aura**:
* 🟢 **Green Aura** ($\le 2.0$ tonnes): Paris Agreement individual target.
* ❇️ **Emerald Aura** ($\le 4.5$ tonnes): Moderate footprint, below Western averages.
* 🔵 **Sapphire Aura** ($\le 8.0$ tonnes): Average footprint for European/urban lifestyles.
* 🟡 **Amber Aura** ($\le 15.0$ tonnes): High footprint, typical of frequent flyers/commuters.
* 🔴 **Crimson Aura** ($> 15.0$ tonnes): Critical footprint, requiring immediate habit reform.

### 2. Real-Time Habit Sandbox
Interact with toggles and sliders to simulate shifting habits (e.g. commuting by EV, switching to a green energy tariff, going vegetarian) and watch your twin's score and Aura recalculate in real-time.

### 3. Visceral Earth Consequences
Translates abstract carbon figures into visual, real-world consequences scaled to 10,000 people living similarly:
* **Arctic Ice Melted** (in square meters of ice sheet)
* **Tree-Years Required** (years of mature tree absorption)
* **Transatlantic Flights** (equivalent emissions in air travel)
* **Total Energy Footprint** (in kilowatt-hours)

### 4. AI Carbon Coach (Powered by Gemini 2.5)
A direct conversational agent built using the `@google/generative-ai` SDK. The coach is context-aware: it knows your assigned Aura, your exact annual score, and your habit history, tailoring all advice specifically to your profile.

### 5. Interactive Purification Quests
Gamified real-world checklists (e.g. "Unplug Vampire Electronics," "Meatless Monday," "Line-Dry Clothes"). Completing quests directly saves carbon, which is subtracted from your twin's score, dynamically updating your aura and progress.

### 6. Green Future Comparison
Side-by-side projections over a 5-year period comparing your current lifestyle trajectory against an improved lifestyle trajectory. Shows cumulative CO2 saved, monetary savings (USD), and health score indicators.

### 🔒 Security Implementations
* **Rate Limiting**: API routes `/api/generate-twin` and `/api/carbon-coach` run server-side in-memory rate-limiting per IP address to safeguard Gemini quotas.
* **HTTP Security Headers**: Next.js config enforces Content Security Policy (CSP), clickjacking protection (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`), and mime-sniffing safeguards (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`).
* **Input Validation**: All client payloads and Gemini JSON responses are validated through Zod schemas.
